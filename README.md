## About

MesPronos is a Drupal 8 module which aims to provide all the features needed to administrate a sport betting website.

This is a "work in progress" module, without a stable release date (maybe late spring for UEFA Euro 2016 ?)

## Planning

Please see [milestones](https://github.com/mespronos/mespronos/milestones) to get an overview of the planning.

Basicaly, I would like to create an open test during march - april - mai, to test the **8.x-1.0 alpha** versions. 

After this three months test I aim to release the **8.x-1.0 beta** that will be used during UEFA Euro 2016.

The **8.x-1.0 Final** should be released during summer.

**[ALPHA TEST IS OPEN !](https://mespronos.net?utm_source=github&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=github-readme)**
